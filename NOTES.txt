server side render-next.js seo performance and user epeirence fast speed

-tailwind UI, 
fetch data from api,
search functionality usestate




TODOS

1. once the user searches within the search page , the datepicker remains open
    NEED TO hide it,or reset state to 0.
    NEEDS TO remain the search values on the search bar.

solution: the header recieves a prop which is the query parameters and if true it renders that as the placeholder value. 
so that state remains 0 and it is closed.
this happens because when the search pushed to a new page route. the state gets lost. 
however, when on the search page it doesnt redirect anywhere and state remains OPEN.

2. change the dummy data API and connect it to a database. could be STRAPI or FIREBASE? 
    WHICH ONE TO CHOSE?
    1. STRAPI
                -serves as practice for Beela website, TechFleet's website, and to learn more about Docker,Kubernetes.
    2. FIREBASE 
                -realtime API


3. Allow user authentication as a customer and as a AirBnb HOSTER.
    NEED TO allow users to book a airbnb. 
    each airbnb needs an owner,dates,title,photos,availability.
    -need to check for availability on all airbnb's and return them based on the query on the search page.
    -product page needs to retrieve the one product. [dynamic generating the page.]

4. Style the MAPBOX so it looks like the Real AirBNB coor pallette

5. implmement map on search page
    NEEDS to be able to show the card map (lat,lang) onclick of the card.
    -solution- update the state of the viewport.

6. Make sure the map marker can close.
    Need to ass a X at the top right.
    and make sure the text doesnt move the pin from place.
